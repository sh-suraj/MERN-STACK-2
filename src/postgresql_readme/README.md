# PostgreSQL Notes & Practice

A **well-structured PostgreSQL learning repository** built using real `psql` terminal practice.
Designed for **beginners**, **backend developers**, and **interview preparation**.

This repository demonstrates not just SQL syntax, but **how and why queries are written**.

### Notes

| File                            | Description                              |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `postgresql-beginner-notes.md`  | Concept-based learning with explanations |
| `postgresql-interview-notes.md` | Fast revision + interview questions      |

### Practice (Hands-on)

| File           | Content                                                 |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `example.md`   | SQL fundamentals                                        |
| `example02.md` | CASE, joins, relationships, views                       |
| `example03.md` | Procedures, functions, window functions, CTEs, triggers |

> Example files are intentionally kept **raw and terminal-based** to reflect real-world usage.

## Topics Covered

- SQL execution order
- Filtering (`WHERE`, `HAVING`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`)
- Aggregations (`COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`)
- CASE expressions
- Table relationships (1:1, 1:N, M:N)
- Joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, CROSS)
- Views
- Stored Procedures
- User Defined Functions
- Window Functions
- CTE (WITH clause)
- GROUP BY ROLLUP
- Triggers

## Why This Repo Stands Out

✔ Uses **real psql output**
✔ Covers **interview-level SQL**
✔ Clear separation of **theory vs practice**
✔ Demonstrates **database design thinking**

---

## Ideal For

- SQL / PostgreSQL beginners
- MERN / Backend developers
- DBMS interview preparation
- Students learning relational databases

---

## Interview Tip

> Interviewers care more about **how you think** than how much you remember.

Always explain:

1. What problem the query solves
2. Why a specific clause is used
3. How data flows through the query
